The concept of ETX (Expected Transmission Count) has been developed by
Douglas S. J. De Couto at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_Transmission_Count).

The original ETX design has been done by the Berlin Freifunk Network
(see www.freifunk.net and www.c-base.org), the code and message format
was coded by Thomas Lopatic.

Fisheye was implemented by Thomas Lopatic in 2005.

The LQ-Plugin rewrite was done by Henning Rogge in 2008.

The NIIT kernel module was written by lynxis in 2009.

The asymmetric gateway tunnel functionality was written by Markus Kittenberger
and Henning Rogge, but the concept was used by B.A.T.M.A.N before OLSRd.



    2.) Link quality algorithm
**********************************

Concept:
--------

OLSRd (since version 0.5.6) uses a dimension-less integer value as a
representation of the 'cost' of each link. This is often called Link Quality
(LQ for short). There are multiple LQ plugins, each of them calculating a cost
for the links of the router. At the moment (version 0.6.0) all LQ plugins are
using an ETX-metric (Expected Transmission Count) but other metrics would be
possible and imaginable, such as MIC [0], etc.


Each link is described by an LQ/NLQ (Link Quality/Neighbor Link Quality) value
pair, which describe the quality towards the router (LQ) and towards the
neighbor (NLQ). Both LQ and NLQ can be values between 0 and 1. The total cost
of the link is calculated as ETX = 1.0/(LQ * NLQ). The ETX value of a link can
be seen as the number of retransmissions necessary to deliver the packet to the
target. ETX 1.0 mean a perfect link without packet loss.

       A                  B
     +---+              +---+
     |   |  <--- LQ --- |   |
     |   |  ---- NLQ -->|   |
     +---+              +---+

Note that the LQ and NLQ are always as seen from one nodes' perspective: the LQ
of node B towards A is the percentage of packets that B can transmit to A.
Hence, in the OLSR ETX implementation, B has to tell A it's LQ.

OLSRd chooses the path towards a target by selecting the path segments with the
smallest sum of link costs. In other words:

   best_path(A,B) = minimum_sum({set of all paths between A and B})


Configuration:
--------------

The link quality system is activated by setting the configuration variable
"LinkQualityLevel" to 2.

You can use the "LinkQualityAlgorithm" parameter to choose the current
link quality algorithm in the configuration file. Some embedded OLSRd versions
are only compiled with one plugin (mostly etx_ff), so don't use the
configuration option with these agents.

There are four different link quality algorithms in OLSRd 0.6.0, two
current Funkfeuer/Freifunk ETX implementations and two legacy implementations.

LinkQuality-Algorithm "etx_ff":
-------------------------------

"Etx_ff" (ETX Funkfeuer/Freifunk) is the current default LQ algorithm for OLSRd.
It uses the sequence number of the OLSR packets (which are link specific)
to determine the current packet loss rate. Etx_ff includes a hysteresis
mechanism to suppress small fluctuations of the LQ and NLQ values. If
no packets are received from a certain neighbor at all, a timer begins
to lower the calculated LQ value until the next packet is received or
the link is dropped.
Etx_ff uses only integer arithmetic, so it performs well on embedded
hardware having no FPU.

The message format of etx_ff is compatible with etx_fpm and etx_float.


LinkQuality-Algorithm "etx_ffeth"
--------------------------------

"Etx_ffeth" is an experimental and INCOMPATIBLE extension of etx_ff (meaning it
is not interoperable with etx_ff nodes).  The problem with etx_ff, etx_float
and etx_fpm is that they calculate Ethernet links with the same cost as a
wireless link without packet loss (ETX=1.0) because the encoding of etx_ff
cannot encode link costs lower than 1.0. This means OLSRd prefers a single
wireless link with some loss (e.g. ETX=1.5) over a two hop route with one
Ethernet link (ETX=1.0) and one perfect wireless link (ETX=1.0) *even though*
the 2 hop path would be better!

"Etx_ffeth" tries to work around this problem by introducing a special
LQ encoding value ETX=0.1, which is only used for Ethernet
links without packet loss. Because of the different encoding, etx_ffeth
is not compatible with etx_ff, etx_fpm or etx_float. These three
implementations detect etx_ffeth nodes with LQ 0 (ETX infinite).

etx_ffeth uses only integer arithmetic, so it performs well on embedded
hardware.

All Ethernet interfaces must be marked with "mode ether"
(see olsrd.conf.default.full) in their interface configuration to get any
useful advantage of etxff_eth.

At the time of this writing, etx_ffeth is the preferred metric for building new
mesh networks which include links over LAN cables (such as daisy chained
Linksys routers).


Legacy LinkQuality-Algorithm "etx_float"
----------------------------------------

"Etx_float" calculates the ETX value by using exponential aging (with
a configurable aging parameter) on the incoming (or lost) Hellos.
It is easier to understand than etx_ff, but the results are not as
good as with etx_ff, since it cannot use the TC messages for link
quality calculation.
Etx_float uses floating point math, so it might use more CPU on embedded
hardware.

The message format of etx_float is compatible with etx_fpm and etx_ff.


Legacy LinkQuality-Algorithm "etx_fpm"
--------------------------------------

"Etx_fpm" is a fixed point math implementation of etx_float. It
calculates the same link qualities as etx_float, but is much faster
on embedded hardware.

The message format of etx_fpm is compatible with etx_float and etx_ff.


Building your own LinkQuality Algorithm
----------------------------------------

With the supplied samples OLSRd can be easily extended to support different
metrics. Please take a look at src/lq_plugin*.[ch] for inspiration and get in
contact with us on the OLSR development mailing list in case you plan to
implement a new metric.



    3.) Fisheye
*******************

Normally OLSR floods all topology control (TC) messages to all
routes in the mesh, which can create a lot of overhead for large
meshes with hundreds of routers. Reducing the rate of TCs can reduce
this overhead, but delay route changes and correction of errors
in the routing tables.

The Fisheye (sometimes called Hazy Sighted Link State Routing [1])
mechanism implements a strategy to reach a compromise between
these two problems. When activated only every 8th TC is send
to all mesh nodes. Most TCs are given a reduced TTL (time to live)
and are only transmitted to the neighborhood of the router.

The current sequence of TTLs with active Fisheye mechanism is
2, 8, 2, 16, 2, 8, 2 and 255 (maximum TTL).

The problem with Fisheye is that it introduces artificial borders
for flooding TCs, which can theoretically lead to inconsistent routes
and routing loops at the border of the Fisheye circles. In practice
Fisheye seems to work well enough that it is a mandatory feature
for most larger Funkfeuer/Freifunk meshes.


    4.) NIIT (ipv4 over ipv6 traffic)
*****************************************
(see https://dev.dd19.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=niit.git;a=summary)

NIIT is a special Linux kernel device that allows easy transmission of IPv4
unicast traffic through an IPv6 network. Since version 0.6.0 OLSRd has
integrated support for NIIT in the routing daemon. So setting up IPv4 traffic
over IPv6 OLSR meshes is very easy. Instead of creating routes and tunnels by
hand all the administrator of a router needs to do is to, is to set up his own
IPv4 targets as "IPv4-mapped" IPv6 HNAs.

Example configurations:
- connect a local 192.168.1.0/8 net to the mesh

HNA6 {
  0::ffff:C0A8:01:00 120
}

- announce an IPv4 Internet gateway

HNA6 {
  0::ffff:0:0 96
}

(German)


    5.) Smart gateways (asymmetric gateway tunnels)
*******************************************************

The smart gateway mechanism was written by Markus Kittenberger and
Henning Rogge to allow an OLSR user to directly choose their default
Internet gateway instead of relying on the hop by hop decisions on
the way to the gateway. OLSRd 0.6.0 can create an IPIP tunnel
to the gateways OLSRd address to side-step the same nasty effects
described in the NAT-Threshold section.

The smart gateway code can be split into two sections, one is
responsible for announcing the existence of a smart gateway uplink
and one (on the client nodes) to choose an uplink and create the
tunnel to the gateway. It uses a modified (but backward compatible)
special HNA to signal the gateways to the clients. The clients can
use a plugin (or the integrated default code) to choose one of the
available gateways and change it if necessary.

The smart gateway system is setup by several configuration parameters,
most of them with a sane default setting. The whole system can be
switched on/off by the following parameter:

SmartGateway <yes/no>

All other parameters will be ignored if SmartGateway is set to "no"
(the default is "no").

On the client side there is a single additional parameter which
controls if you want to allow the selection of an outgoing ipv4
gateway with NAT (Network Address Translation).

SmartGatewayAllowNAT <yes/no>

The uplink side of the smart gateway code has four parameters to
set up the type of the uplink:
1- SmartGatewayUplink defines which kind of uplink is exported to the
   other mesh nodes. The existence of the uplink is detected by looking
   for a local HNA of 0.0.0.0/0, ::ffff:0:0/96 or 2000::/3. The default
   setting is "both".
2- SmartGatewayUplinkNAT defines if the ipv4 part of the uplink uses NAT.
   The default of this setting is "yes".
3- SmartGatewaySpeed sets the uplink and downlink speed of the gateway,
   which could be used by a plugin to choose the right gateway for a
   client. The default is 128/1024 kbit/s.
4- SmartGatewayPrefix can be used to signal the external IPv6 prefix of
   the uplink to the clients. This might allow a client to change it's
   local IPv6 address to use the IPv6 gateway without any kind of address
   translation. The maximum prefix length is 64 bits,
   the default is ::/0 (no prefix).

SmartGatewayUplink <none/ipv4/ipv6/both>
SmartGatewayUplinkNAT <yes/no>
SmartGatewaySpeed <uplink> <downlink>
SmartGatewayPrefix <prefix>

On the smart gateway server (the OLSR instance announcing 'Internet here!' via
HNA 0/0 or similar) the implicit tunl0 interface is used to forward incoming
packets originating on smart gateway clients to the Internet route. This may be
protected by the sysctl rp_filter setting. Note, that at least with RedHat
kernel 2.6.18, the net.ipv4.conf.tunl0.rp_filter sysctl file is not present
after loading the "ipip" kernel module, which prevents OLSRd from switching off
the filter. As a workaround, add an "ip addr add 0.0.0.0/32 dev tunl0" after
the "modprobe ipip" line in your OLSRd startup script.

While the smart gateway function does a fine job on stand-alone PCs, system
builders should keep in mind the following facts when setting up routing,
firewalls and gateways:

a) The smart gateway tunnel communicates asymmetrically. An IP packet destined
   for an Internet server is sent via the IPIP tunnel but returned via the
   standard OLSRd host route.

b) On the smart gateway server, you should double check your firewall rules and
   rp_filter defaults. While it's normally not possible to simply encapsulate
   (for example) a "telnet 127.0.0.1" into IPIP and sent that to the smart
   gateway server, your specific configuration may open up such attack vectors
   for an intruder.

c) Do not forget to open up the firewall for tunl0->Internet traffic and (if
   required to NAT/MASQUERADE) this communication path.

d) While the smart gateway server does not use special routing, the smart
   gateway client inserts policy routing rules for it's function. By using the
   default configuration, the OLSRd standard default route is maintained in
   table 223 and the OLSRd smart gateway default route in table 224. Both
   tables are examined only, if you do not have a default route in the main
   table (visible with "ip route ls"). Use "ip route ls table 223" or
   "ip route ls table 224" for debugging/monitoring. You may also activate the
   txtinfo plugin and do a "wget -O - http://localhost:2006/gateway".

e) For a standalone client (a notebook user running OLSRd in order to browse)
   the lowered IPIP tunnel MTU is no problem. If you do proxy routing, e.g. for
   attached LAN clients without OLSRd, you may want MSS-clamping for the tunnel
   interface created by OLSRd. Because OLSRd uses an arbitrary name for the
   tunnel interface (e.g. tnl_7c41c668) you may want to include a wildcard
   iptables rule. Example:
     iptables -A FORWARD -o tnl_+ -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN \
              -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu

Furthermore (or alternatively) you might consider (on your gateway nodes)
clamping all traffic leaving your mesh to your ipip mtu (regardless if the
traffic comes out of the smart gateway tunnel or not!). Example:
  iptables -A FORWARD -o [your_gateway_interface] -p tcp \
           --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --set-mss 1480

Especially as during OLSRd startup, before an smart gateway is chosen (which is
delayed), new connections would use a larger MSS than the smart gateway tunnel
can handle. So the approach to clamp on the gateways should give better results.

But if you don't NAT on your gateways (but want to use smart gateway for some
special reason), you would have to do this on ALL gateways (even on gateways
that do not provide the smart gateway functionality!).


    6.) NatThreshold
************************

The NatThreshold option was introduced by Sven Ola to suppress a very annoying
problem with OLSRd, switching default gateways. If a router is located between
two Internet gateways with similar path costs the default route (0.0.0.0/0)
will constantly switch between the two gateways due to normal fluctuations of
the link metrics. Whenever OLSRd decides that the other NAT gateway is
"better", then switching to this new gateway will result in termination of all
connected sessions (TCP and HTTP).
The user experience will be rather painful and users will experience hanging
SSH and HTTP sessions (or anything using TCP).

NatThreshold tries to help by introducing a hysteresis factor for
choosing the route to the default gateway. Only if the new gateway has
a lower cost than the current gateways path cost multiplied by
NatThreshold the node will switch the gateway.
In short:

  if (cost(new_gateway) < cost(current_gw)*NatThreshold)) {
	switch_gateway();
  }


Practical experience shows that this leads to much better quality of default
gateway selection, even if (in theory) a small NatThreshold together with
Fisheye can lead to  persistent routing loops.
Please note that even with NatThreshold enabled, some users will still
experience gateway switching. However, most users will not.

Smart Gateways can replace NatThreshold all together because they allow sending
traffic directly to a gateway circumventing the problems described above which
stem from a hop-by-hop routing approach
