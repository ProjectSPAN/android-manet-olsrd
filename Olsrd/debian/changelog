olsrd (0.6.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream version with quite some fixes and new features, see upstream
    changelog for details. Quoting from there:
     Change in version number system. No more -rcX for release candidates and
     -rX for bugfix releases. In future bugfix releases or updates of plugins
     will increase the third digit of the version string while feature 
     releases will increase the first and/or the second one.
   Removed the following patches from series trying to make it build again:
   - 100-debug_level.patch
   - 240-plugin-install-targets.patch
   - 260-quagga-plugin-detect-protocol-version.patch
   - 270-make-kfbsd.patch
   
  THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS and needs checking whether those patches are still
  needed. Also 0.6.1 is out.

  * Update package description, OLSR is no experimental protocol anymore.
