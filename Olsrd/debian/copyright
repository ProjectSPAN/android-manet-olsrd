 | As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains
 |  part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work
 |  under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a
 |  parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof
 |  as a parser skeleton.  Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute
 |  the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this
 |  special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting
 |  Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public
 |  License without this special exception.
 |
 | This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in
 | version 2.2 of Bison.
