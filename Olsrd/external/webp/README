Description:
============

WEBP decoder: libwebpdecode.so is a simple library for
decoding WEBP image files. 

See http://code.google.com/speed/webp


It is released under the same license as the WebM project.
See http://www.webmproject.org/license/software/ or the
file "COPYING" file for details. An additional intellectual
property rights grant can be found in the file PATENTS.


API:
====

This is mainly just one function to call, so just have a look at
the file src/webp/decode.h for the details and variants:

#include "webp/decode.h"
uint8_t* WebPDecodeRGB(const uint8_t* data, uint32_t data_size,
                       int *width, int *height);

A lower-level API is available from the header file <webp/decode_vp8.h>


Building:
=========

If everything goes right, then:

./configure
make
make install

should be all you need to have the following files

/usr/local/include/webp/decode.h
/usr/local/include/webp/decode_vp8.h
/usr/local/lib/libwebpdecode.*

installed.


Decoding example:
=================

there's a decoding example in example/dwebp.c which will take a .webp file and
decode it to a PPM image file. This is simply to demonstrate use of the API.
You can verify the file test.webp decodes to exactly the same as test_ref.ppm:
  `cd examples && ./dwebp test.webp -o test.ppm && diff test.ppm test_ref.ppm`
