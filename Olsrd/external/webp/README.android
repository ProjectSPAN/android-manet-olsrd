Local modifications:
- Rewrite Android.mk to remove duplicate definitions and set module name
  in a consistent way with other external libraries
- Move public headers from src/webp to include/webp, so path to headers
  may be appended into CFLAGS without risk for other private headers
  (e.g. bits.h) to leak into
- Sync-patch with libwebp ver 0.1.2
- Removed Build files necessary for building via autoconf/automake tools
  These files are not required to build via Android.mk
  - Makefile.am  Makefile.vc Makefile.in
  - config.h.in configure config.guess config.sub configure.ac
  - autogen.sh install-sh missing depcomp ltmain.sh aclocal.m4
- Added WebP Encoder (ver 0.1.2) as well
  - Removed some more unused Makefile.am & Makefile.in
  - Added Android.mk to encoder & decoder code levels.

The Android.mk file creates WebP Decoder and Encoder static libraries which
can be added to any application by Adding to LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES
libwebp-decode libwebp-encode:

  LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES += libwebp-decode libwebp-encode
