CHANGELOG AS OF 0.2.2

0.2.6 -------------------------------------------------

Minor updates

UPDATES
Some simple code rewrites and bugfixes.
Route deletion using IPv6 should work now.


0.2.5 -------------------------------------------------

Lots of updates.

REWRITES

Rewritten queuing structure.
Route information is removed from main tab.

PIGGYBACKING

The front-end now supports piggybacked messages.


0.2.2 -------------------------------------------------

HELLO PARSING ERROR

The parsing of HELLO messages didnt handle grous of neighbors
bigger than 1 if there existed more than one group. This because
the implementation did not check for several IP addresses but
just incremented the struct-array index. A kindof ugly hack fixed
this.

MESSAGE RECIEVING

Recieving of messages not complete - fixed. One could risk just recieving
half a message the way it used to be implemented.
