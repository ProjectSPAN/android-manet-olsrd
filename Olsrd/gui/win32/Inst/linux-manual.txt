DESCRIPTION
       olsrd is an implementation of the Optimized Link State Routing protocol
       for  Mobile  Ad-Hoc  networks(MANET).  The  protocol  is  described  in
       RFC3626.  It is designed to be run as a standalone server process - but
       as it is still in an experimental stage most users will prefer  running
       it with some debug output which is directed to STDOUT.


       This  manual page only lists the command line arguments. For details of
       the configuration file see the comments  included  in  /etc/olsrd.conf.
       Note  that  none  of these options need to be set at the command line -
       all these options and others can be set in the configuration file.

OPTIONS
       -i interface1 ... interfaceN
                   This option specifies  on  what  network  interfaces  olsrd
                   should  run.  These interfaces cannot be aliased interfaces
                   such as eth0:1.

       -f configfile
                   This option overrides the default configuration  file  path
                   used by olsrd - /etc/olsrd.conf

       -d debuglevel
                   This option specifies the amount of debug information olsrd
                   should write to STDOUT. If set to 0 olsrd will run  in  the
                   background.

       -ipv6       This  option  instructs  olsrd to use the Internet Protocol
                   version 6. The default is version 4.

       -ipc        This option allows the GUI front-end created fro  olsrd  to
                   connect to olsrd at runtime.

       -dispin     This option, when set, causes olsrd to display all incoming
                   packet data on STDOUT. When using IPv4  the  data  is  dis-
                   played  in decimal format, when using IPv6 the data is dis-
                   played in hexadecimal format.

       -dispout    This option, when set, causes olsrd to display all outgoing
                   packet  data  on  STDOUT.  When using IPv4 the data is dis-
                   played in decimal format, when using IPv6 the data is  dis-
                   played in hexadecimal format.

       -tnl        When  this  option is set olsrd will use IP-in-IP tunneling
                   to Internet gateways. This is very experimental code and it
                   should not be used as of yet.

       -delgw      If  this option is set olsrd will remove any default routes
                   set prior to adding an Internet route based on  OLSR  rout-
                   ing.

       -bcast broadcastaddress
                   This option specifies what IPv4 broadcastaddress to use for
                   OLSR control traffic. The only value that  currently  makes
                   sense   when   setting   broadcast   address  mannually  is
                   255.255.255.255.  The default action is to use  the  broad-
                   castaddres  that  the  network  interface  is preconfigured
                   with(per interface).

       -hint seconds
                   This value sets the interval on which HELLO messages should
                   be  generated.  The value is a floating point number repre-
                   senting seconds.

       -nhint seconds
                   This value sets the interval on which HELLO messages should
                   be  generated  on  interfaces  that  are not detected to be
                   wireless.  The value is a floating point number  represent-
                   ing seconds.

       -tcint seconds
                   This value sets the interval on which TC messages should be
                   generated. The value is a floating point number  represent-
                   ing seconds.

       -midint seconds
                   This  value  sets the interval on which MID messages should
                   be generated. The value is a floating point  number  repre-
                   senting seconds.

       -hnaint seconds
                   This  value  sets the interval on which HNA messages should
                   be generated. The value is a floating point  number  repre-
                   senting seconds.

       -hhold multiplier
                   This  option  sets  the  announced HELLO validity time as a
                   multiplier of the HELLO interval.

       -nhhold multiplier
                   This option sets the announced HELLO validity time on  non-
                   WLAN interfaces, as a multiplier of the HELLO interval.

       -thold multiplier
                   This option sets the announced TC validity time as a multi-
                   plier of the TC interval.

       -tos TOS-value
                   This option sets the type of service value that  should  be
                   set in the OLSR control traffic packet IP headers.

       -T seconds  This  option  sets  the polling intervall of the scheduler.
                   The default is 0.1 seconds. This option should only be con-
                   sidered if running with really low emission intervals.
