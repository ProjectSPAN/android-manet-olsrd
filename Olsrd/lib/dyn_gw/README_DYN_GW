DYNAMIC INTERNET GATEWAY PLUGIN FOR olsr.org olsrd
by Andreas Tonnesen(andreto@olsr.org)
Additions by Jens Nachitgall and others

ABOUT

Plugin is IPv4 only and it only runs on Linux with the libpthread
library installed!

This is a plugin that checks if the local node has a Internet-
connection. A Internet-connetion is identified by a "default gw" with a
hopcount of 0. That is a route to 0.0.0.0/0 with metric 0.  By default
the check is done every 5 secs. You can change the check interval by
providing an value for "PingInterval" in the plugin's section of olsrd.conf.

If one or more IPv4 addresses are given as values for "Ping" in the
section or dyn_gw in olsrd.conf, then a test is done to validate if
there is really an internet connection (and not just an entry in the
routing table). If any of the arbitrary many given IPv4 addresses can be
pinged, the validation was successful. The addresses are pinged in the
order given in the olsrd.conf (i.e. the first given address is pinged
first, the the 2nd, and so on). For this to work a command like 
"ping -c 1 -q <PING-ADDRESS>" must be possible on the system olsrd runs
on. The validation is based on the return value of this ping command.

Since OLSR uses hopcount/metric on all routes this plugin will
not respond to Internet gateways added by olsrd.

When a Internet gateway is discovered - this node will start
announcing 0.0.0.0/0 connectivity by HNA messages flooded into
the OLSR network. If the route is removed the HNA messages
will not be transmitted. This check is totally dynamic and
Internet connectivity might come and go.

This plugin can also process more specific routes by specifying groups of HNAs
(Host and Network Association) and ping hosts. 

This plugin will work very good with a automatic network cable
detection daemon such as  netplug:

This plugin is a good example of using plugins for other stuff
than packet transmission.

HOW TO USE (version 0.5)

LoadPlugin "olsrd_dyn_gw.so.0.5"
{
    # The plugin check interval can be set here in milliseconds.
    # The default is 1000 ms (1 second).
    PlParam     "CheckInterval"  "5000"
    
    # The ping check interval in case there is any pinged host specified.
    # The default is 5 seconds.
    PlParam     "PingInterval"   "40"
    
    # If one or more IPv4 addresses are given, do a ping on these in
    # descending order to validate that there is not only an entry in
    # routing table, but also a real network connection. If any of
    # these addresses could be pinged successfully, the test was
    # succesful, i.e. if the ping on the 1st address was successful,the
    # 2nd won't be pinged.
    #
    # The Ping list applies to the group of HNAs specified above or to the 
		# default internet gateway when no HNA is specified.
		#
		# Running the plugin without parameters acts as the 'old' dyn_gw_plain.
    
    #   The following ping entries for the internet gateway
    PlParam "Ping"   "141.1.1.1"
    PlParam "Ping"   "194.25.2.129"
    
    #   First group of HNAs with related ping host
    PlParam	"HNA"	   "192.168.80.0 255.255.255.0"
    PlParam	"HNA"	   "192.168.81.0 255.255.255.0"
    PlParam	"Ping"	 "192.168.81.12"
    
    #   Second HNA group with multiple related ping hosts.
    #   Specifying multiple ping hosts provides redundancy.
    PlParam "HNA"    "192.168.100.0 255.255.255.0"
    PlParam "HNA"    "192.168.101.0 255.255.255.0"
    PlParam "HNA"    "192.168.102.0 255.255.255.0"
    PlParam "Ping"   "192.168.100.10"
    PlParam "Ping"   "192.168.101.10"
    
    #   Third HNA group without ping check
    PlParam "HNA"    "192.168.200.0 255.255.255.0"
    PlParam "HNA"    "192.168.201.0 255.255.255.0"
    PlParam "HNA"    "192.168.202.0 255.255.255.0"
}

Change log:

18.02.2010
  Caspar van Zon / C2SC
- Changed HNA checking.
  The 'Ping' PlParam processing has been modified so that it is not only valid 
	for the previous HNA entry but all entries proceeding the ping parameter until 
	either the beginning of the list or the previous ping parameter.
	If there is no previous HNA entry then HNA '0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0' for the internet
	gateway is inserted instead.
- Two new interval parameters 'PingInterval' and 'CheckInterval' have been
  introduced. 'PingInterval' is the new name for the 'Interval' parameter, the
  old name has been maintained as well for compatibility. The 'CheckInterval' is
  new and specifies the check interval for the OLSR event loop in milliseconds.
- When no ping hosts are specified at all the thread for the ping check will not
  be started, eliminating the thread totally is left for future improvement.
- Code and variable names have been cleaned up in various places to improve both
  readability and maintainability.
- Due to significant changes in the code base and the modified functionality the
  version of the package has been increased to version 0.5
- Running the plugin without parameters acts like dyn_gw_plain so the 
  dyn_gw_plain plugin can be made obsolete.

  bjoern Riemer
- added universal hna checking
  the plParams are parsed in spechial order, first the HNA parameter syntax: "net mask"
  the following Ping parameter are only used for the previus HNA entry.
  if there is no previus HNA entry then HNA "0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0" for internet GW is assumed

30.11.2004

  updates by Jens:

- Upgraded to confirm with v2 plugin interface
- removed IPC stuff
- Removed much unnessecarry stuff
- Added an optional validation based on the ping command, which caused
  some internal restructuring, e.g. the dependency of a threading
  library)
- the config file accepts an "Interval", meaning how often the check is
  done
