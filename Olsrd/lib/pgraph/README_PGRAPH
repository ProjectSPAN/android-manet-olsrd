Parser: OLSRConnect.py
Description: This parser has been written to interface with a plugin for
	     the version 4.9 OLSR from olsr.org.  The plugin can also be 
	     found in this directory.  

Parser for OLSR: 	OLSRConnect.py
Plugin for OLSRv4.9:	olsr_v4.9-pgraph-plugin

Usage:
	1) Copy the "olsr_v4.9-pgraph-plugin" directory from this distribution
	   to the "/<your OLSRv4.9 path>/lib/."

	2) cd to the "/<your OLSRv4.9 path>/lib/." directory, 
           run "make" and "make install"
	   This will create the "olsrd_pgraph.so.1.1" file and install it. 

	3) Modify the "/etc/olsrd.conf" file of the system you wish to
	   monitor from to load the plugin. 
	   Add the line: "LoadPlugin "olsrd_pgraph.so.1.1" {}"

	4) The plugin actually allows any host to connect regardless of
           what is specified in the olsrd.conf file.  This is currently 
           done for testing purposes and due to the fact that the "Host" 
           parameter in the olsrd.conf file never worked.  

           # By default only localhost will be able to connect to the IPC
	   # system of the olsrd process so if you are not going to be 
	   # running pgraph locally, modify the "Host" variable of the 
	   # "IpcConnect" structure in the "/etc/olsrd.conf" file to 
	   # reflect the IP address of the host you will be connecting from. 

	5) Start olsrd and make sure that the plugin has loaded correctly.

	6) On the machine you will be running pgraph from, use the 
	   "OLSRConnect.py" parser to connect to the olsrd plugin and pipe
	   the output to pgraph. 

Usage: (note the use of the backquote "`") 
"python  OLSRConnect.py <ip of machine running plugin> 2004 | `python pgraph.py`"

- Where the "2004" above is the default port that the plugin will be listening on.

To kill pgraph when using the parser:
- Hit "Ctl-C" in the terminal.
