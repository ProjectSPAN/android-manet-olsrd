This changelog states changes from version 0.2

0.6 - Adjustments made to ensure data going out is converted to
      network byte ordering.  Also, to ensure incoming data is
      converted before it is used and before checksums are calculated
      as well.
0.5 - A local MD5 implementation can now be compiled
      into the plugin so that no external library
      is needed. Should be great for embedded systems.
      MD5 might not be super-secure, but hey... it
      still takes quite some effort to break ;)
0.4 - Plugin now compiles under FreeBSD and win32.
      To compile under win32(cygwin) you have to
      make sure the openssl include directory
      is present under /usr/include/mingw/
      The plugin is not tested under win32.   
0.3 - Only some minor fixes to make the plugin work
      with olsrd 0.4.6.
      Dynamic interface removal/addition supported.
