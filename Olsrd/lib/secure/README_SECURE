Secure OLSR 0.4 implementation notes
(c)Andreas Tonnesen 2004

This document contains information on how to
use the secure OLSR plugin with the UniK olsr daemon.
It does _not_ cover secure OLSR protocol issues.

Lines starting with '# ' indicates shell commands.

NOTES

  The plugin interface and olsrd output buffering was
  heavily rewritten for the 0.4.8 release. The plugin
  should work with this release - but has not been
  tested much.

COMPILING

  To compile simply do:
  # make
  This compiles the local MD5 function and the plugin has
  no external dependencies.
  If you want the plugin to use SHA-1 using the openssl libs
  do:
  # make USE_OPENSSL=1

INSTALLING

  To install:
  # make install

  This will run ldconfig to update the dynamic linker.
  It might take a while.

USAGE

  To make olsrd load the secure OLSR plugin add the
  following in the olsrd configuration file:

LoadPlugin "olsrd_secure.so.0.6"
{
    PlParam     "Keyfile"   "FILENAME"
}

  replacing FILENAME with the full path of the file
  containing the shared key.

  The plugin uses this shared secret key for signature
  generation and verification. For nodes to participate 
  in the OLSR routing domain they need to use the key 
  used by the other nodes.
  The key is 128-bits of size and is read from the
  specified file from the config file or by default from:
  /etc/olsrd.d/olsrd_secure_key

  Copy the key to this file an all nodes. The plugin
  will terminate olsrd if this file cannot be found.

  Now start olsrd and the let the plugin do its
  thing :)
