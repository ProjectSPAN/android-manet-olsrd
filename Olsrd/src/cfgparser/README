The configparser can be built in three ways.

1. As part of olsrd. This is done when building olsrd.

2. As a binary executable. Just do 'make' in the current
   directory(src/cfgparser). The binary will be called
   olsrd_cfgparser

3. As a shared library. Do 'make MAKELIB=1' in the current
   directory(src/cfgparser).


the parser can both parse configfiles and write such files
based on provided data.

More to come.
