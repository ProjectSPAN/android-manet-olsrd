Instructions for FreeBSD libnet build

libnet URL: http://www.packetfactory.net/libnet/
FreeBSD Ports: /usr/ports/net/libnet-devel/


The BSD networking is missing features that prevent the use of
multiple interfaces with olsrd.  By using libnet we can get around
the problem and support this feature.

1) From the FreeBSD ports collection install libnet-devel, plain
   libnet is NOT sufficient!

  % cd /usr/ports/net/libnet-devel
  % make install

   Additionally, you must have gmake installed (/usr/ports/devel/gmake)

2) If you're reading this, you have the proper olsrd distribution.  So
   I won't bore you with getting that.

3) Change into the main directory of the olsrd source and build the
   daemon:

  % cd <blah>
  % gmake OS=fbsd-ll

4) If that succeeds, then just follow all the other documentation on
   the use of olsrd.

The code is pretty ugly right now and I know there are some efficiency
things I can do to make it better.  Bug reports, better ways to do
this are welcomed.
