<H1>Olsr_Switch network simulation</H1>
</P>
<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>This document gives a brief introduction to the <A HREF="http://www.olsr.org/">olsr.org</A>
OLSR daemon network simulation extentions and tools. The network
simulation tool olsr_switch provides olsrd processes running in a
special <I>host-emultion</I> mode with access to a virtual network.
Multiple such processes can run on a host. This network can be freely
manipulated by the user allowing for simulation of dynamic
large-scale networks. 
</P>
<P>Only IPv4 is supported for now. 
</P>
<H2>Background</H2>
<P>olsr_switch was inspired by the uml_switch used to communicate
between <A HREF="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">UML</A>
instances, which I have used for olsrd testing. Also I remember
seeing that the guys at LRI working on the <A HREF="http://qolsr.lri.fr/">qolsr</A>
project has done something similar. 
</P>
<P>The target users for this kind of things are probably mainly
developers and researchers. But it might come in handy for others as
well. 
</P>
<H2>Description</H2>
<H3>olsr.org</H3>
<P>The olsr.org OLSR daemon is an implementation of the <A HREF="http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc3626.txt">Optimized
Link State Routing protocol</A> a IP routing protocol for mobile
ad-hoc networks. Multiple interesting extensions are available for
the implementation. Read more at <A HREF="http://www.olsr.org/">olsr.org</A>.
</P>
<H3>olsr_switch</H3>
<P>The application, called olsr_switch, is really a traffic router
that will allow multiple olsrd instances to connect and communicate
over TCP via the loopback interface. Connecting to olsr_switch on
remote hosts will be possible, but it is not implemented at the
current time. 
</P>
<P>Basically olsr_switch works on two datasets - clients and links. A
client is a connected olsrd process and there are two uni-directional
link between all nodes(A-&gt;B and B-&gt;A) that can be manipulated
independently. When receiving traffic from a olsrd client the switch
will forward this traffic to all other clients to which it has a
valid link. Links can be set to three different &quot;modes&quot;
based on the <I>quality</I> set on the link: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Open</B>(quality 100) - all
	traffic will be forwarded over this link. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Closed</B>(quality 0) - no
	traffic will be forwarded over this link. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Lossy</B>(quality 1-99) - in this mode the quality
	constraint is used as the chance in percentage, for traffic to be
	forwarded over the link. So if quality is set to 25 there will in
	average be 75% packet loss. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>The application provides the user with a prompt/shell where
various commands for topology manipulation or data retrieval are
available. A help command is provided for the users convenience. This
help command will also provide the user with specific help on all
available commands. More on this later. 
</P>
<H3>olsrd host-emulation clients</H3>
<P>The communication interface against olsr_switch can naturally not
be 100% transparent for the olsrd process which normally runs on
UDP/698 on &quot;real&quot; network interfaces. Olsrd itself had to
be modified to set up a virtual interface connecting to olsr_switch.
This virtual interface is transparent to all overlying functionality.
This means that that olsrd host-emulation can run in both RFC and LQ
mode, and that plugins can be loaded normally etc. But no routes are
added by the olsrd process. Later on route information might be
signaled from the olsrd instance to olsr_switch so that a centralized
route database is available to the user. As of now, you can watch the
olsrd debug output or easier yet, run one node with the httpinfo
plugin to get the route/topology/link information. 
</P>
<P>Currently olsrd cannot run on both real and host-emulation
interfaces, but this might change in the future if I get convinced
that it is useful. No routes can be added by the host-emulating olsrd
instances, so 
</P>
<H2>Building and running</H2>
<P>As of yet, olsr_switch builds and runs on GNU/Linux and FreeBSD
systems. 
</P>
<H3>Building</H3>
<P>The olsr.org olsrd source code and pre-compiled packages can be
downloaded from the olsr.org <A HREF="http://www.olsr.org/index.cgi?action=download">download</A>
section. But as of now you need the CVS version if you want the
olsr_switch code. To check out the current snapshot do: 
</P>
<PRE>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/olsrd login

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/olsrd co olsrd-current</PRE><P>
Now enter the olsrd source directory and do: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">olsrd-current# make</PRE><P>
to build olsrd itself, and: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">olsrd-current# make switch</PRE><P>
to build olsr_switch. If no error messages occurred, you should now
have the two executables <I>olsrd</I> and <I>olsr_switch</I>
available in the current directory. 
</P>
<H3>Running</H3>
<P>Before starting any olsrd host-emu clients the switch must be
started. This is done using the command <I>olsr_switch</I> and the
application will initiate the communication socket and provide the
user with a prompt for input: 
</P>
<PRE>olsrd-current# ./olsr_switch
olsrd host-switch daemon version 0.1 starting
Initiating socket TCP port 10150
OHS command interpreter reading from STDIN
&gt;</PRE><P>
<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>olsrd_switch has a buildt-in command for starting and
stopping local olsrd instances and we will learn more about 
this later. But olsrd can also be ran in host-emulation mode
from the command line. To start olsrd in host-emulation mode do: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">./olsrd -hemu <B>IP-ADDRESS</B></PRE><P>
Here <I>IP-ADDRESS</I> will be the IP address that the process will
set as its main address in the emulation mode. This address has no
connection to the real IP-stack and can be chosen freely. Of cause,
no two instances can run using the same IP.<BR>It might be wise to
have a separate olsrd configuration file for host-emulation. In that
case issue: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">./olsrd -f <B>FILENAME</B> -hemu <B>IP-ADDRESS</B></PRE><P>
As of now there is no emulated destination address used. All traffic
will be passed on regardless of the network address used. Olsrd
communicates using broadcast/multicast so that multiple &quot;overlapping&quot;
networks might exist. 
</P>
<H2>Command-line interface</H2>
<P>Blah blah blah 
</P>
<H3>help</H3>
<P>Type 'help cmd' for help on a specific command 
</P>

<P>The <I>list</I> command is used for client and link listing. The
help page states: 
</P>
<PRE>&gt; help list
Usage: <B>list &lt;clients|links&gt;</B>
Description:
<I>This command will list all the clients or all the links registered </I>
<I>by olsr_switch. By default clients are listed.</I></PRE><H3>
link</H3>
<P>The <I>link</I> command is used for manipulating links. Here is
the help page for this command: 
</P>
<PRE>&gt; help link
Usage: <B>link &lt;bi&gt; [srcIP|*] [dstIP|*] [0-100]</B>
Description:
<I>This command is used for manipulating olsr links. The link quality </I>
<I>is a number between 0-100 representing the chance in percentage </I>
<I>for a packet to be forwarded</I>
<I>on the link.</I>
To make the link between 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2 have 50% packetloss do:
 link 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 50
Note that this will only effect the unidirectional link 
10.0.0.1 -&gt; 10.0.0.2. To make the changes affect traffic 
in both directions do:
 link bi 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 50
To completely block a link do:
 link 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 0
To make all traffic pass(delete the entry) do:
 link 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 100
Note that &quot;bi&quot; can be used in all these examples.
Wildcard source and/or destinations are also supported.
To block all traffic from a node do:
link 10.0.0.1 * 0
To set 50% packetloss on all links to 10.0.0.2 do:
 link * 10.0.0.2 50
To delete all links do:
 link * * 100
Wildcards can also be used in combination with 'bi'.
To list all manipulated links use 'list links'.</PRE>
<H3>olsrd</H3>
<P>The <I>olsrd</I> command is used for manipulating links. Here is
the help page for this command: 
</P>
<PRE>
> help olsrd
Usage: <B>olsrd [start|stop|show|setb|seta] [IP|path|args]</B>
Description:
<I>This command is used for managing local olsrd instances from within olsr_switch.</I>
<I>The command can be configured in runtime using the setb and seta sub-commands.</I>
To show the current olsrd command-configuration do:
 olsrd show
To set the olsrd binary path do:
 olsrd setb /full/path/to/olsrd
To start a olsrd instance with a IP address of 10.0.0.1, do:
 olsrd start 10.0.0.1
To stop that same instance do:
 olsrd stop 10.0.0.1
</PRE>
<H3>others</H3>
<P>Two other commands are available: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>exit</B> - terminates
	olsr_switch. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>log</B> - sets the log level. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Read the help pages for details. 
</P>
<H2>Running olsrd in host-emulation mode</H2>
<P>Now for a real world example of connecting olsrd instances. Let's
assume we have a modified configuration file, <I>./olsrd.emu.conf</I>
that we use for host-emu instances. We'll choose the 10.0.0.0/24 IP
address space for our clients.<BR>First start the olsr_switch in one
terminal: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">./olsr_switch</PRE><P>
Now start the olsrd instances in other terminal(s). If you want to
follow olsrd operation you should use a debug value &gt; 0. To easen
CPU usage and terminal count you can start multiple instances that
will run in the background using the <I>-d 0</I> option. In this
example we'll run our olsrd instances in the foreground using debug
level 1. Start them off(in separate terminals) using: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">./olsrd -f /etc/olsrd.emu.conf -hemu 10.0.0.x -d 1</PRE><P>
where x is 1-8(we'll run 8 instances). The <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</A>
terminal multiplexer application is <I>highly</I> recomended for
making your life easier if working on multiple terminals. 
</P>
<P>Here is the output form the 10.0.0.1 instance of olsrd after some
time:

<H2>Manipulating links</H2>
<P>So lets create some link trouble. This introduction has become too
long already, so we'll introduce two simple example conditions: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We want 10.0.0.1 only to have a

	traffic trough to 10.0.0.2,3,4 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Here's what we need to do: 
</P>

</PRE><P>
Now our first condition is met. First all bidirectional links from
10.0.0.1 was blocked and then the bidirectional link to 10.0.0.2 was
opened. Now 10.0.0.1 can only see 10.0.0.2 as a neighbor. Note that
only manipulated links are listed when issuing 'list links'. olsrd at
10.0.0.1 now shows:

Yes, there most certainly are some very weak links here. 
</P>
<P>Well, lets leave it at that :-) The command line interface is
meant to be used by applications as well as humans, so if somebody
wants to create a GUI front-end that should not be to much work. 
</P>
<H2>Performance</H2>
<P>Regarding CPU load I have not done any real testing, but I did try
seeing how far I could get on my 1.3Ghz/512MB-RAM desktop system
running LQ olsrd instances in the background initiated from olsrd_switch. 
When reaching a certain amount (15+) the cPU load is very high for 
neighbor detection, but as soon as links stabelize the CPU is almost
idle again. I have ran with 30+ nodes with no problem. But do not start
to many instances at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Note that, this
was only using a idle network(no topology changes except new nodes joining). 
But as soon as olsrd instances can connect from other hosts one can 
distribute the load. Also the application will be subject to various future
optimizations.
</P>
<P>
Network load measurement tools will also be on the to-do list.
